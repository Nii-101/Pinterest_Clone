# Slightly Techie capstone project
## This is my attempt at creating a responsive pinterest clone as my site of choice

* Link to the site: [Pinterest Clone](needleterest.netlify.app) *

### Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS (Tailwind framework)
- Javascript

### Personal Choices
- Added a color mode toggle button to allow users to switch between light and dark modes easily
- Added red rings around the various boxes in dark mode so that images with black backgrounds look better


### Contact Me
- [Email](noelamptey101@gmail.com)
- [Phone Number]((+233)20-241-179)


#### NB:
- The only functionality available on mobile devices at the moment is toggling between the light and dark mode
- The site is just meant to be a test of my ability to replicate and innovate certain designs so it may or may not be made fully functional in the future
- For a more extensive _but still very limited_ user experience, try to access the site on desktop
